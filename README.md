TASK1 | Credit Scoring Model
This code develops a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data. The process includes generating synthetic data, preprocessing it, training a Logistic Regression model, and evaluating its performance. Key steps involve splitting the data into training and testing sets, standardizing the features, and training the model. The output includes accuracy, a detailed classification report, and visualizations like a confusion matrix and ROC curve, which help assess the model's performance in predicting whether individuals are likely to be creditworthy.

TASK3 | Handwritten Character Recognition
The code builds a handwritten character recognition system using the MNIST dataset. It preprocesses the data, normalizes pixel values, and transforms labels.
The program output includes test accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and Matplotlib plots showing training/validation accuracy and loss trends. These elements provide insights into the model's performance in classifying data and minimizing errors when recognizing handwritten digits.

TAsk4 |  Heart Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning with Python.This program predicts the likelihood of heart disease occurrence using the 'heart_disease.csv' dataset. It preprocesses the data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its accuracy. The model classifies individuals as either having heart disease (1) or not (0) based on their health parameters.
